# Plane-Image-Classification
Classifying flying vehicles taking images as input

I used Tensorflow to solve this multi label classification problem. In the training model, we use Convolutional Neural Networks which contain convolutional layers, Pooling layers. 

Though this program runs at a 70% efficiency rate, I believe I could use the concept of Transfer Learning to create a better program to classify images.
